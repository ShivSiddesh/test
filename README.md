# LIFT and SHIFT Approach
One of the easiest and least expensive ways to migrate an existing workload to the cloud is to take the workload as-is and run it on cloud-native resources: this is known as the “Lift and shift” approach. (IAAS – Rehost or Replatform)
•	Does not demand any application-level changes as it is merely being rehosted on the cloud.
•	Allows you to migrate your on-premises identity services components such as Active Directory to the cloud along with the application.
